The code belonging to my bachelor's thesis "Quantum Machine Learning for Event Classification at the LHC". I implemented quantum circuits in the context of quantum machine learning, including the tensor products of gates and the parallel computation of multiple input feature vectors.

I compared implementations of Quantum Machine Learning using either Numpy or Pennylane with respect to runtime and the scaling properties for increasing numbers of qubits or layers. The results were compared with classical machine learning approaches with respect to their performance on the LHC Olympics dataset and the decision boundaries these approaches enabled.
